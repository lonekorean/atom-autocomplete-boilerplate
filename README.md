# YGOPro API Autocomplete plugin for Atom

This is an autocomplete plugin for Atom that covers the YGOPro API.

Currently, the translations from the chinese docs are still weird, and some are just
missing, so any help to improve them would be very appreciated.

## Features

- [x] Autocompletes constants, class names and methods.
- [ ] Autocompletes card static methods (condition, cost, target, operation, etc).
- [x] Provides description for each constant, method, etc.
- [x] Adapts method calls for `.` and `:`.
